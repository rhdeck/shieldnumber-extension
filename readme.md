# You Deserve Two Phone Numbers

Protect your privacy by with a phone number that doesn't ring. 

[ShieldNumber](https://shieldnumber.com) is a phone number that receives voicemails and texts without requiring you to answer or receive a notification. You will get an email at the end of the day or week with a summary of all your messages. It's like having a receptionist answer and hold your calls. Now you can get on with the important work in your life! 

Give your friends and family your cell phone. Give ShieldNumber to everyone else.
